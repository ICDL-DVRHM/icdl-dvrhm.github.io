# Overview

| **Date** | Half-Day workshop on May 20, 2024 at [ICDL 2024](https://www.icdl.com/conferences/dir2024) |
| **Location** | Jacob Javits Convention Center, New York City |

# Abstract
 
How do we learn to visually understand our environment ? Recent advances showcase the potential ground-breaking role of new machine learning models to answer that question; for instance, it is now possible to apply bio-plausible computational learning principles on realistic egocentric views and compare the outcome to those of biological systems. Yet, this novel methodology requires a cross-disciplinary expertise, between psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning. In this workshop, we aim to boost this burgeoning research by bringing together cross-disciplinary researchers interested in the development of visual representations. The focus will be on examining the latest advances in the development of visual representations. Through keynote presentations, we will highlight the existing disparities between human and machine vision, encouraging interdisciplinary exchange and collaborative endeavour.
